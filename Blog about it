Introduction

Most AI tools today focus on giving fast answers. While this is useful, real-world technical decisions are rarely about a single “correct” answer. Developers often need help choosing between multiple valid options, each with its own advantages and drawbacks.

For Week 6 of the Kiro Heroes Challenge, I built “The Referee” — a decision-support tool that compares options, explains trade-offs, and guides users toward better choices instead of simply providing conclusions.

Problem Statement

Developers frequently face questions such as:

Which API approach should I use?

Which cloud service fits my constraints?

Which tech stack is suitable for my team?

The challenge is not the lack of information, but the lack of structured decision guidance. Most tools either overwhelm users with data or give opinionated answers without context.

How the Tool Works

The tool accepts:

A decision question

User constraints (team experience, budget, scale, delivery speed)

Multiple options with scores

Each option is evaluated using the same dimensions:

Ease of use

Cost

Scalability

Flexibility

The tool then:

Displays pros and cons for each option

Calculates a score



Role of Kiro in Development

Kiro’s spec-driven development helped structure the agent’s behavior clearly:

Neutral and unbiased comparisons

Constraint-based reasoning

Decision steering instead of direct answers



Conclusion

The Referee demonstrates how AI agents can guide users through complex decisions responsibly. Instead of replacing human judgment, it enhances it.

This project aligns perfectly with the Kiro Heroes goal of Agent Steering — helping users choose wisely, not blindly consume information.
